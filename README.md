The codes presented here are divided into two cathegories: (i) Numerical Diagonalisation, corresponding to the data depicted in Figs. 1 - 5 from the paper,
and (ii) Variational Method, corresponding to Figs. 6 - 10 and Table 1.

#Numerical Diagonalisation

Each of its folders contain different functions and/or subroutines that the programs for the Figures employ. The latter are found in the Figures folder.
